# SeasonDisplay
A React app that uses the Geolocation API to determine the user's latitude and displays the corresponding season. For example, if the user is in the northern hemisphere and the month is July, the app will return summer as the season. 

This app is a demonstration of knowledge of class-based components, conditional rendering and state in React.
